# Day 2: On your own

Assuming you've done some programming before, this section should take you
about two hours, or more depending on how well you write your solutions. Here
I pose some sample problems that you can work on your own. I also provide
sample solutions with comments on Python style.


## Project Euler
It's nice to work on problems without worrying about real-world applications.
For this reason, I point you to
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) to do some problems on the
first page. I'll provide different ways of doing the first five problems, and
hopefully you'll be able to judge how well your solution is in terms of style
and efficiency.
