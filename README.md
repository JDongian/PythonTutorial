#PythonTutorial

Welcome to Python3.3 in 2 hours!

This is a beginner's introduction to Python 3 originally for an IEEE:CS event.

We assume you come from a C/C++ background, and are interested in something
fun to add to your repitoire. Python is concise, popular, and fun. Easily spin
up web APIs, format text, implement machine learning algorithms, or anything
you can think of with Python's huge module support.

Even if you already know Python, be sure to come out and spread the joy! Learn
the latest Python 3 and help others out. You might learn something new.

##day0
Python setup tutorial, if you want to dev on your own machine
(highly reccomended). We will provide servers to ssh into if you aren't
capable to work on your own machine. Be sure to have an SSH client at least
(PuTTy for Windows).

##day1
What Python is and what it can do; an introduction to idiomatic Python and
challenges that python solves easily.

###Part 1
* Text manipulation and file I/O with Python
* EE312 2013fall project1 in Python

###Part 2
We'll get you started on HackerNews scraper that demos the all-awesome
requests library as well as BeautifulSoup's super cool HTML parsing abilities.

##day2
It's time for you to learn on your own now. Take a look at the python docs,
work some exercises, and have fun. I provide some pedagogical solutions to
Project Euler problems to show different possible approaches to problem
solving in Python, and the various tools you have available to you.


This project is a work in progress.
